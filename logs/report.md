    "report": "# Independent and Small Business Flooring Retailers in Miami, FL: A Comprehensive Report\n\nThis report identifies and details independent and small business flooring retailers in Miami, FL, excluding large national chains like Home Depot, Lowe's, and Ace Hardware. The report synthesizes information from various sources, including industry publications, consumer resources, and company websites, to provide a comprehensive overview of the Miami flooring market.\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n*   **Market Fragmentation:** The flooring retail industry is highly fragmented, with numerous geographically specific and specialized independent retailers. This contrasts with the concentrated market share of a few large national chains. This fragmentation benefits consumers by providing diverse options and localized expertise.\n*   **Mobile Showroom Trend:** Floor Coverings International (FCI) operates primarily through a mobile showroom model, bringing samples directly to customers' homes. This differentiates them from traditional brick-and-mortar stores and caters to customer convenience.\n*   **Emphasis on Customer Service:** Many independent retailers, including FCI and Dolphin Carpet & Tile, emphasize personalized service, design consultations, and post-installation follow-up guarantees. This focus on customer satisfaction is a key competitive advantage against larger, less personalized retailers.\n*   **Wide Product Variety:** Independent retailers offer a broad range of flooring materials, including hardwood, carpet, tile, laminate, stone, luxury vinyl, and area rugs. Many carry products from major national brands, and some, like Dolphin Carpet & Tile, offer their own branded products.\n*   **Importance of Installation:** Proper installation is crucial for flooring longevity and warranty protection. Consumer Reports highlights the importance of considering installation location, method, and subfloor conditions. FCI emphasizes manufacturer-approved installation processes.\n* **CPF Floors Dealer Focus:** CPF Floors is a supplier that mainly works through independent dealers.\n* **JV Wood Floors:** Sells and Installs CPF brand flooring, among other brands.\n\n## Identified Retailers:\n\nThis section details the identified independent and small business flooring retailers in the Miami, FL area.\n\n### 1.

They emphasize catering to the Florida climate.\n\n### 2. Floor Coverings International (FCI) - Multiple Miami Locations\n\n*Note: FCI operates on a franchise model, so each location is independently owned and operated.*\n\n**A.

Other FCI locations**\n* Note that other FCI locations may exist in the wider Miami area. Since they are independently owned and operated, it is important to search by specific area.\n\n### 3. JV Wood Floors (Plantation, FL - *Serves Greater Miami Area*)\n\n*   **Website:** Not directly provided, but easily searchable.\n*   **Phone:** Not directly provided, but easily searchable.\n*   **Address:** 6761 West Sunrise Blvd Unit 8, Plantation, FL 33313\n*   **Products:** Coreproof (CPF) waterproof laminate, luxury vinyl, hardwood, rectified porcelain, and installation products. Brands include Coreproof (CPF) and others.\n*   **Services:** Installation services.\n*   **USP:** 5-star rating, offers a wide variety of flooring types and brands, including the 100% waterproof Coreproof laminate. Although located in Plantation, they likely serve the broader Miami area.\n\n### 4. CPF Floors (Supplier, not a retailer, but relevant)\n* **Website:** Not directly provided, but easily searchable.\n* **Phone:** Not Directly provided.\n* **Address:** Not directly provided, likely operates nationally.\n* **Products:** Waterproof flooring (rigid core vinyl and waterproof laminate), Core Steps, Core Moldings, and Underlayment.\n* **Services:** Dealer-focused business model, offering resources for dealers, rapid order fulfillment (98% of orders ship within 48 hours).\n* **USP:** Specializes in waterproof flooring, fast shipping, and supports a network of independent retailers. This is important because it indicates the presence of *other* smaller retailers in Miami that carry their products, though those retailers are not specifically named in the provided research.\n\n## Industry Context and Consumer Considerations:\n\n*   **Industry Growth:** The US floor covering stores industry is substantial ($59.0 billion in revenue in 2024) and growing, driven by residential and nonresidential construction trends. However, the industry is also volatile due to fluctuating housing starts, interest rates, and consumer spending.\n*   **Consumer Reports Recommendations:** Consumers should consider factors beyond cost and aesthetics, including:\n    *   Installation location and existing subfloor.\n    *   Installation method (DIY vs. professional).\n    *   Need for underlayment.\n    *   Material thickness and wear layer.\n    *   Surface texture and edge style.\n*   **Independent Testing:** Consumer Reports conducts independent testing of various flooring types, assessing resistance to foot traffic, scratches, stains, dents, water, and sunlight, as well as slip resistance.\n*   **Installation Costs:** Installation costs vary widely by material. HomeAdvisor estimates an average cost of $3,131 to install new flooring in a 320-square-foot room, with significant variation depending on the chosen material. FCI advises caution with quotes significantly lower than average, suggesting potential quality compromises.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe Miami, FL flooring market offers a diverse range of options for consumers, with a strong presence of independent and small business retailers. These retailers compete with national chains by offering personalized service, extensive product selections, and specialized expertise. Consumers should carefully consider their needs and priorities, taking into account factors beyond price and aesthetics, and leverage the expertise of local retailers to make informed decisions. The presence of suppliers like CPF Floors, which primarily serve independent dealers, suggests that there are likely *more* small, unnamed retailers in the Miami area than those explicitly identified in this report. Further research, including local directories and online searches with more specific geographic parameters, could uncover additional options.\n\n\n## Sources\n\n- https://www.floorcoveringweekly.com/main/retail/top-us-specialty-flooring-retailers-of-2022-37495\n- https://floorcoveringsinternational.com/locations/us/fl/metro-miami/\n- https://cpffloors.com/dealer-locator/\n- https://www.consumerreports.org/home-garden/flooring/buying-guide/\n- https://www.dolphincarpet.com/north-miami-aventura/\n- https://floorcoveringsinternational.com\n- https://floorcoveringsinternational.com/locations/us/fl/miami-beach/miami-shores/\n- https://floorcoveringsinternational.com/locations/us/fl/metro-miami/miami/\n- https://archive.org/stream/publicaccount1993v2v3onta/publicaccount1993v2v3onta_djvu.txt\n- https://jvwoodfloors.com/product-category/flooring/flooring-laminate-floors/cpf-laminate/\n- https://www.michigansthumb.com/sitemap/7270000-7275000.xml\n- https://www.dolphincarpet.com/ft-lauderdale-fl/\n- https://www.houzz.com/professionals/hardwood-flooring-dealers/miami-fl-us-probr0-bo~t_28349~r_4164138\n- https://www.dolphincarpet.com/hardwood-flooring/\n- https://www.dolphincarpet.com/\n- https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/floor-covering-stores-industry/",
