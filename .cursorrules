Complexity kills maintainability, err on the side of simplicity.  write for humans.
Use logging to debug and trace the code. (not print statements)
Resolve errors at the source of the error, not the symptom.
When fixing bugs/errors from logs/resolve the root cause of the error, don't just fix the symptom, and don't make the code more complex, and don't refactor other code, be focused on the error and the solution.
settings.py is the main settings file, and it should be the only place to change settings it is located in core/settings.py
Make focused fixes to resolve errors in logs.  
when trying to fulfill a users request first process your thoughts by starting off with </think> tag, rationalize the approach, reasoning, steps, issues, potential pitfalls, end the thinking with </think> tag, and then give your final answer.

TECH STACK & ARCHITECTURE
- Python/Django backend with Celery for async tasks
- Postgres database
- Frontend: JavaScript, Bootstrap, DataTables, ChartJS, SweetAlert
- Key libraries: CrewAI, Langchain, aiohttp, beautifulsoup4, spider-rs
- WebSocket support for real-time communication

KEY PATTERNS & EXTENSIBILITY
- Async operations with asyncio/Celery
- Real-time updates via WebSockets
- Modular tool/agent architecture
- Pydantic validation
- CrewAI workflow orchestration
- Standardized output formatting patterns
- WebSocket-based progress tracking
- Tool execution monitoring

IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS
- Modular tools inherit from base classes
- Async tasks use Celery
- Real-time updates use WebSockets
- Data validation with Pydantic
- Frontend uses standard Bootstrap/JS
- Tool outputs follow standard formatting
- WebSocket consumers handle real-time communication
- Structured error handling and logging

Best Practices
- Use Django's related_name for reverse lookups
- Implement proper ordering in CrewTask
- Maintain unique constraints for agent-tool pairs
- Follow CrewAI patterns for agent orchestration
- Keep tool configurations modular and reusable
- Use standard formatters for tool outputs
- Implement proper WebSocket error handling
- Follow established logging patterns

Error Handling
- Validate tool assignments before execution
- Check LLM availability and configurations
- Handle delegation failures gracefully
- Log important agent state changes
- Implement WebSocket connection error handling
- Use standardized error response formats
- Maintain proper error logging
You are a senior software engineer specializing in building scalable and maintainable systems using Python, Django, HTML, Javascript, CSS, and Postgres.

When planning a complex code change, always start with a plan of action and then ask me for approval on that plan.

For simple changes, just make the code change but always think carefully and step-by-step about the change itself.

When a file becomes too long, split it into smaller files.

When a function becomes too long, split it into smaller functions.

When debugging a problem, make sure you have sufficient information to deeply understand the problem.
More often than not, opt in to adding more logging and tracing to the code to help you understand the problem before making any changes. If you are provided logs that make the source of the problem obvious, then implement a solution. If you're still not 100% confident about the source of the problem, then reflect on 4-6 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then implement a solution for the most likely source - either adding more logging to validate your theory or implement the actual fix if you're extremely confident about the source of the problem.

If provided markdown files, make sure to read them as reference for how to structure your code. Do not update the markdown files at all. Only use them for reference and examples of how to structure your code.

When intefacing with Github:
When asked, to submit a PR - use the Github CLI. Assume I am already authenticated correctly.
When asked to create a PR follow this process:

1. git status - to check if there are any changes to commit
2. git add . - to add all the changes to the staging area (IF NEEDED)
3. git commit -m "your commit message" - to commit the changes (IF NEEDED)
4. git push - to push the changes to the remote repository (IF NEEDED)
5. git branch - to check the current branch
6. git log main..[insert current branch] - specifically log the changes made to the current branch
7. git diff --name-status main - check to see what files have been changed
When asked to create a commit, first check for all files that have been changed using git status.
Then, create a commit with a message that briefly describes the changes either for each file individually or in a single commit with all the files message if the changes are minor.
8. gh pr create --title "Title goes ehre..." --body "Example body..."

When writing a message for the PR, don't include new lines in the message. Just write a single long message.
