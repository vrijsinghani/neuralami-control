Always prefer simple solutions
Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod
You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested
When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we don't have duplicate logic.
Keep the codebase very clean and organized
Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point
