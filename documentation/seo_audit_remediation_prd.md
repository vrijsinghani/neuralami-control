Date: [Today's Date]
Version: 1.0
Objective
To enhance the SEO audit tool by integrating a feature that generates a detailed, step-by-step remediation plan for web pages with SEO issues using multiple LLM calls. This feature will provide users with actionable insights to improve their website's SEO performance.

Features
1. LLM Integration
Multiple LLM Calls: Utilize the LLMService to make multiple calls for generating a comprehensive remediation plan.
Input Data: Include client business profile, page URL, page HTML, and a list of issues.
System Prompt: Use a structured prompt to guide the LLM in generating detailed and actionable recommendations.
2. UI Enhancements
Generate Plan Button: Add a button in the 'URL Groups' section of results.html to initiate the remediation plan generation, with a dropdown to select the provider and model.
View Plan Button: Include a button to view previously generated plans for the same URL and audit.
3. Data Persistence
Database Storage: Store the generated remediation plan in the database, associating it with the specific audit and URL and model used.
Plan Retrieval: Implement functionality to retrieve and display the stored plan in the UI.
4. Workflow Steps
Issue Categorization: Group issues by severity and type to prioritize the remediation process.
Detailed Recommendations: Provide specific, actionable steps for each issue.
Validation and Testing: Suggest methods for validating changes and testing SEO compliance.
Documentation: Encourage documentation of changes and suggest follow-up audits.
Functional Requirements
1. Frontend
Modify results.html to include buttons for generating and viewing remediation plans.
Use JavaScript to handle button clicks and make AJAX requests to the backend.
2. Backend
Create a new API endpoint or view to handle LLM requests and responses.

3. Database
Add a new model or extend an existing one to store remediation plans.
Ensure the model includes fields for audit ID, URL, and plan content.
Non-Functional Requirements
Security: Ensure only authorized users can generate and view remediation plans.
Performance: Optimize LLM calls to minimize response time.
Scalability: Design the system to handle multiple concurrent LLM requests.
