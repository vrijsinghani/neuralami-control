2. **Configuration Management**
   - ConfigMaps for application configuration
   - Secrets for sensitive information
   - Environment-specific settings

3. **Resource Allocation**
   - CPU and memory requests and limits
   - Horizontal Pod Autoscaler configuration
   - Node affinity and anti-affinity rules

### Monitoring and Alerting

1. **Metrics Collection**
   - Prometheus for metrics scraping
   - Custom metrics for application-specific monitoring
   - Grafana for visualization

2. **Alerting**
   - Alert on job failure rate exceeding threshold
   - Alert on worker node failures
   - Alert on resource saturation

3. **Logging**
   - Structured logging with JSON format
   - Log aggregation with Elasticsearch
   - Log visualization with Kibana

### Backup and Recovery

1. **Redis Persistence**
   - RDB snapshots for point-in-time recovery
   - AOF for transaction logging
   - Regular backups to external storage

2. **Job Data**
   - Periodic export of job results to persistent storage
   - Ability to recreate jobs from configuration
   - Data retention policies

### Scaling

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Add worker nodes based on queue size
   - Scale API service based on request rate
   - Scale Redis based on memory usage

2. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Adjust resource allocation based on usage patterns
   - Optimize for specific workload characteristics
   - Balance between CPU and memory resources

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Browser Stability**
   - Risk: Browser crashes or memory leaks
   - Mitigation: Regular browser restarts, memory monitoring, process isolation

2. **Redis Performance**
   - Risk: Redis becomes a bottleneck under high load
   - Mitigation: Redis Cluster for sharding, optimized data structures, caching

3. **Network Reliability**
   - Risk: Network failures or timeouts
   - Mitigation: Retry mechanisms, circuit breakers, connection pooling

### Operational Risks

1. **Resource Contention**
   - Risk: Worker nodes compete for resources
   - Mitigation: Resource quotas, priority classes, node anti-affinity

2. **Data Volume**
   - Risk: Large crawl jobs produce excessive data
   - Mitigation: Result size limits, data compression, tiered storage

3. **System Overload**
   - Risk: Too many concurrent jobs overwhelm the system
   - Mitigation: Job queuing, admission control, graceful degradation
